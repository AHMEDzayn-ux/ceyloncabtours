  story: `Ceylon Cabs was founded with a passion for hospitality and a deep love for Sri Lanka. What started as a small family-run business has grown into one of the most trusted cab services in the country.

Our team of experienced drivers knows every corner of this beautiful island - from the ancient ruins of Anuradhapura to the pristine beaches of the south coast, from the misty hills of Nuwara Eliya to the wildlife-rich jungles of Yala.

We take pride in not just being drivers, but being your local guides, sharing stories, recommending authentic restaurants, and ensuring every journey becomes a memorable part of your Sri Lankan adventure.`,
