# Gallery Images

## How to Add Images

Simply place your photos in this directory (`public/images/gallery/`).

### Supported Formats

- `.jpg` / `.jpeg`
- `.png`
- `.webp`
- `.gif`

### Naming Convention

- No need for specific naming! The system will automatically:
  - Load all images from this folder
  - Sort them alphabetically
  - Generate alt text from the filename

### Example Filenames

- `sigiriya-rock-fortress.jpg` → Alt text: "Sigiriya Rock Fortress"
- `ella_nine_arch_bridge.png` → Alt text: "Ella Nine Arch Bridge"
- `galle-fort.webp` → Alt text: "Galle Fort"
- `001.jpg` → Alt text: "001"
- `photo-2024-01-15.jpg` → Alt text: "Photo 2024 01 15"

### Tips

- Images are lazy-loaded automatically when the gallery page is visited
- The gallery uses a masonry layout with lightbox functionality
- Recommended image size: 1200px width (will be automatically optimized)

- You can add as many photos as you want!
